## Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using uploaded CSV crime dataset  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing with Python & Jupyter Notebook  
- Interactive visualizations: bar charts, heatmaps, line charts  
- HTML file for sharing visual results  
- Ready-to-run Google Colab notebook (link below)  
- Actionable insights for crime prevention and urban management

## File Structure

- `Cleaned Crime Data Set.csv` – Raw crime dataset  
- `CrimeData.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook for cleaning, analysis, and visualization  
- `CrimeData.html` – Exported HTML with interactive charts  
- `main.py` – Python scripts for preprocessing, feature engineering, and plotting

---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+  
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab  
- Required packages (install via `pip install -r requirements.txt`):
  - pandas  
  - matplotlib  
  - seaborn  
  - plotly  
  - numpy  

---
## Installation

git clone https://github.com/ViggiXDevp/DataScience_MachineLearning.git
cd DataScience_MachineLearning
jupyter notebook CrimeData.ipynb


---

## Usage

1. Upload or use the provided CSV dataset.  
2. Follow the notebook instructions to clean, analyze, and generate visualizations.  
3. View visual insights within the notebook or exported HTML file.

---

## Visualizations Included

- **Bar Chart**: Crime counts by type or area  
- **Line Chart**: Trend of crime incidents over time  
- **Heatmap**: Crime density by geographic location  

---

## Real-World Use Case

This dataset enables deep analysis of criminal activity within specific regions and time periods.  
**Law enforcement agencies** and **policy makers** can use these insights to:

- Identify hotspots for targeted policing or community outreach  
- Spot temporal trends to schedule patrols when crime spikes  
- Allocate resources efficiently based on high-incidence areas  
- Adjust public safety programs to respond to emerging threats
