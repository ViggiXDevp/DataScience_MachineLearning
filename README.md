The Crime Data Analysis project aims on explore and analyse crime records through meaningful patterns. By performing thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, data processing and feature engineering, the project seeks to identify trends and patterns related to time, locations and crime patterns. Thorough Visualisation through bar graphs, histograms and heatmaps, it provides insights which are helpful for law enforcement agencies in decision making and resource allocation.
